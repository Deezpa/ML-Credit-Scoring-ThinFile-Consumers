# Dataset Metadata Card: Synthetic Credit Score Data for Thin-File Consumers

## 📂 Dataset Name
Synthetic Credit Score Dataset for Thin-File Consumers

## 📄 Description
This dataset was synthetically generated to model the financial behavior and credit scoring profiles of **thin-file consumers** — individuals with limited formal credit histories. The data mimics real-world financial indicators through simulation techniques, validated against known distribution patterns.

## 🎯 Purpose
To support research on:
- Credit risk assessment in underserved populations
- Development and testing of machine learning models
- Evaluation of bias, fairness, and interpretability in scoring systems

## 📊 Features Summary
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Employment Type, Monthly Income  
- **Traditional Indicators**: Credit Utilization, Credit History Length  
- **Alternative Indicators**: Utility Bill Payments, Mobile Transactions, Psychometric Scores  
- **Target**: Credit Score Label (Binary: Good/Bad Risk)

## ⚖️ Fairness Considerations
- Demographic parity and equal opportunity are evaluated in modeling
- Synthetic design avoids real individual identification
- Includes bias mitigation analysis
